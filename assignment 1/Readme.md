1. Use ridge regression. For the weight decay parameter: consider lambda = 0.01

2. Consider the 80% of the total data as trainind and report performance on the remaining 20% (consider 3-5 80-20 splits and report the average performance).

3. No need to normalize the features: use the features as given.

4. Preferably use python. Ideally, you do not need to use any in-built function.

5. Solve the ridge regression problem with th three linear regression techniques we had in the class. 

1) gradient descent
2) closed form
3) MLE ?
