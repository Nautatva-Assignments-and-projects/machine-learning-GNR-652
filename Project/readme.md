1. Analysed the paper: Bernoulli Random Forests: Closing the Gap between Theoretical Consistency and Empirical Soundness.
2. Wrote a program to check the validity of the paper and establish practical results.
3. Found the average accuracy differed with just 1% along with giving low time complexities as compared to other models such as Breimanâ€™s original ran- dom forests
